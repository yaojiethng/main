e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` represents a field where you can provide the appropriate description, such as `add d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/Assignment 1 p/0` or as `d/Assignment 1`.
* Parameters with a trailing `…` ​can be used as many times as you want, or can also be omitted. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used once as `t/project`, or multiple times like `t/project t/graded`, and so on.
